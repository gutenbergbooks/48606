<p class="bq">"Bird of the silent wing and expansive eye, grimalkin in feathers, feline, mousing,
haunting ruins and towers, and mocking the midnight stillness with thy uncanny cry.
"&mdash;<i>John Burroughs, Birds and Poets.</i></p>

<p>Among the birds of prey (Raptores)
none are better known, more written
about or more cosmopolitan than that
nocturnal division (Family Strigidae),
which includes the two hundred or more
species of Owls. From the Arctic regions
of the north to the Antarctic regions
of the south they are known. Most of the
genera are represented in both hemispheres,
though eight are peculiar to the
Old World and three to the New. The
majority of the species finds a home in the
forests, though a few live in marshes and
on the plains. Some invade the buildings
of civilization and may be found in the
unfrequented towers of churches and in
outbuildings.</p>

<p>Disliked by all birds its appearance
during the day is the signal for a storm of
protests and, knowing that there is little
need of fear of his power at this time, they
flock about him, pecking and teasing him
till he is obliged to retreat to his obscure
roosting place.</p>

<p>The Owls in most countries of both the
New World as well as the Old are regarded
as birds of ill omen and messengers of
woe, and are protected from harm by
some uncivilized and superstitious peoples,
some believing that spirits of the
wicked reside in their bodies. By others
they have been called "Devil's Birds."
The belief of some unlearned people in
the close relationship of the Owl with
death and the grave dates back at least to
the time of Shakespeare, who speaks of the
Owl's hoot as "A song of death." Among
the ancient races only the Athenians seem
not to have possessed this popular fear
and superstition. They venerated the Owl
and regarded it as the favorite bird of Minerva.
On the other hand the Romans
looked upon the Owl with fear and detestation,
dreading its appearance as the
embodiment of all evil and the omen of
unfortunate events to come. By them the
Owl was consecrated to Proserpine, the
wife of Hades and queen of the underworld.
Pliny tells us that the city of Rome
underwent a solemn cleansing because of
the visit of one of these birds. When the
unearthly character of their cries and
their quiet, spirit-like motion, as they fly
through the night hours, are taken into
consideration, it is not surprising that
they have been and are held in awe and
dread by many people. The characteristics
of the two sexes are practically the
same, except that the female is somewhat
the larger. The young resemble the
adults, but are usually darker in color.
Excepting those species that are whitish
in color, the Owls are usually a mixture
of black, brown, rufous gray, yellow and
white, and barring is common on the
wings and tail. Their bills are blackish,
dusky or yellowish. Their eyes are so
fixed that they have little power of turning
the eye-balls and thus are obliged to
turn the head when they wish to change
their range of vision. This they do with
great rapidity, in fact, the motion is so
rapid that without close observation the
bird seems to turn its head in one direction
for several revolutions if the object
looked at passes around the perch upon
which the Owl rests. A remarkable characteristic
is the reversible fourth toe or
digit, enabling the Owl to perch with
either one or two toes behind.</p>

<p>Mr. Evans tells us that "the note varies
from a loud hoot to a low, muffled sound
or a clear, musical cry; the utterance of
both young and adults being in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
cases a cat-like mew, while the screech-owl
snores when stationary. The hoot is
said to be produced by closing the bill,
puffing out the throat, and then liberating
the air, a proceeding comparable to that
of the Bitterns. On the whole the voice
is mournful and monotonous, but occasionally
it resembles a shrill laugh." The
utterances of the Owls are, however,
quite various. Some species will give a
piercing scream and hiss like an angry
cat when disturbed.</p>

<p>The Western Horned Owl of our illustration
is a variety of the Great
Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) of eastern
North America. It has a wide and
extensive range reaching from Manitoba,
on the north, into the table-lands of Mexico
on the south and eastward from the
Pacific coast across the Great Plains. Occasionally
specimens are taken as far east
as the states of Illinois and Wisconsin.
It is replaced in the Arctic regions by the
Arctic Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus
arcticus), which is lighter in color, its
range only reaching as far south as Idaho
and South Dakota. The Western Horned
Owl breeds nearly throughout its range.
It is of interest that this Owl is not an inhabitant
of high altitudes but rather of
the foothills and more open country of
its range. The Dusky Horned Owl
(Bubo virginianus saturatus), the darkest
colored of all the owls, taking its place
in the higher regions.</p>

<p>In its habits it is closely related to its
eastern relative. It has a similar call note
and is as destructive. It feeds on grouse
and ducks as well as other species of valuable
food water-birds. It also kills many
forest birds that are useful to man as insect
destroyers. It is said that they will
feed on mammals, such as pole cats, prairie
dogs, squirrels, rabbits and other rodents.
But this is not the worst crime of
this marauder, for when it visits the more
thickly inhabited districts it appreciates
the delicacies to be found in the poultry
yards of the farmer and kills far more
than it needs to satisfy its appetite.</p>

<p>With regard to the nesting habits of
this Owl, Captain Charles Bendire says:
"While perhaps the majority of these
birds resort to hollow trees or old nests
of the larger hawks and of the common
crow, quite a number nest in the wind-worn
holes in sandstone and other cliffs,
small caves in clay and chalk bluffs, in
some localities on the ground, and, I believe,
even occasionally in badger holes
under ground. On the grassy plains in
the Umatilla Indian Reservation, in
northeastern Oregon, I have several
times seen Owls of this race sitting on the
little mounds in front of badger or coyote
burrows, near the mouths of which small
bones and pellets of fur were scattered
about. While unable to assert positively
that they do actually breed occasionally
in such holes, the indications point that
way, and this would not seem to be due
to the absence of suitable timber, as an
abundance of trees grow along the banks
of the Umatilla river not more than a mile
away. When nesting in trees, large cottonwoods,
sycamores, willows, pecans,
pines, oaks and firs are generally preferred.
In regions, however, where heavy
timber is scarce, they content themselves
with nests in small mesquite and hackberry
trees, frequently placed not more
than ten feet from the ground." Captain
Bendire also states that they have been
known to use the nests of the black-billed
magpie, either laying their eggs on the
inside of these curiously built and enormous
structures or on the broken-down
roofs. These nests are well adapted to
the requirements of the Owl, for they
vary from one to three feet in diameter
and are constructed in a very substantial
manner. The foundations consist of
twigs held together with mud, and upon
this, built of smaller twigs, is the nest,
which is plastered with mud and lined
with grass and small roots. The whole
structure is surrounded by dead twigs,
which form an arch over the top of the
nest. This is a palace which the Owl
would never take the trouble to construct,
but is willing to use.</p>

<p>It is said that the Western Horned Owl
will lay two or more sets of eggs at short
intervals if the nest and eggs are disturbed,
and an instance has been recorded
where three sets of eggs have been taken
from the nest of a single pair at intervals
of about four weeks. The number of
eggs laid is usually two or three, and infrequently
four are found and sets of five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and six have been reported. The eggs
are white, showing, as a rule, but little
gloss and are roughish. In form they
are rounded oval, about two and one-half
inches long, and nearly two inches in diameter.
The period of incubation lasts
about four weeks, and it is said that only
the female sets on the eggs, the male furnishing
her with food.</p>

<p>Like the Great Horned Owl this variety
is quite solitary in its habits, except
during the breeding season, and is almost
as destructive as that bird which is considered
the most destructive of all the
Owls.</p>

<p>The Owl has long been an inspiration
to the poets, due to its odd appearance
and uncanny actions during the daylight
hours, the wise expression of its face, and
its quiet flight during the weird hours of
the night.</p>

  <span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Cyanocitta stelleri macrolopha.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<p>The family (Corvidae) of birds to
which the long-crested jay belongs includes
not only the jays but also the
crows, the ravens, the magpies and the
rooks. It is a cosmopolitan family
with the exception that no representatives
are found in New Zealand. It
includes over two hundred species of
which about twenty-five are inhabitants
of North America. Strictly speaking,
none of the species are migratory, excepting
those whose range carries them
to regions of severe winters. Some of
the species are well protected by soft
and thick coats of down and feathers,
and as they are generous in their selection
of food, eating varieties that may
be procured at any season, they do not
need to move from place to place but
may remain resident throughout the
year.</p>

<p>The jays differ from the crows in
their method of progression on the
ground, hopping instead of walking.
They are distinctly arboreal in their
habits, and usually have a bright-colored
plumage, blue being the most common.
Their heads are often crested.
Though found nearly throughout the
world their highest development seems
to have been reached by those species
that are resident in the warmer portions
of America.</p>

<p>The jays are noisy and quarrelsome,
fretting apparently for the most insignificant
reasons. They are great mimics
and exhibit a high degree of intelligence.
The jay possesses a variety of
notes and calls, and is a notable borrower
of those of some other species of
birds. This versatility has given rise to
the very appropriate name of the sub-family
in which they are included, the
Garrulinae, from the Latin word garrio,
meaning to prattle.</p>

<p>Our illustration shows the color and
markings of the long-crested jay. Its
home is in the wooded regions of the
southern Rocky Mountains, southern
Arizona and the northwestern portion
of Mexico. It breeds throughout this
range.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues has said regarding this
bird that it is "a stranger to modesty
and forbearance, and the many qualities
that charm us in some little birds
and endear them to us; he is a regular
fillibuster, ready for any sort of adventure
that promises sport or spoil, even
if spiced with danger." In spite of
these characteristics they are very quiet
during the nesting season and the female
is very devoted to her nest and
will almost allow herself to be touched
before flying from her eggs. Their
nests are bulky and usually placed in
out-of-the-way places, in low, bushy,
cone-bearing trees. They seemingly
will eat anything of a nutritious nature.
Flying insects, larvae, beetles, flies, spiders,
eggs, and even small birds, seem
to be palatable to their tastes. Yet
they are principally vegetarians feeding
upon seeds, hard fruits and berries
when these are obtainable.</p>

<p>The Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stelleri),
of which the long-crested form is a geographical
variety, is a resident of the
Northwestern portion of North America
ranging from northern California to
southern Alaska and eastward to the
Cascade Mountains.</p>

<h2><a name="A_VICTIM_OF_CIRCUMSTANCES" id="A_VICTIM_OF_CIRCUMSTANCES"></a>
  A VICTIM OF CIRCUMSTANCES.</h2>

<p>Once there had been six little brothers
and sisters, six little fluffy, plush-covered
creatures with tiny silken ears of which
Madam Field Mouse had been so proud
it had been only a delight to take long
trips over the farm for dainty tidbits, if
only for the pleasure of seeing their
bright black eyes sparkle as they speedily
devoured them.</p>

<p>Once there had been six but now there
were only three. Yesterday morning
there had been four, and the morning before,
five. Each night found one less to
snuggle down in the fluffy bed of corn
stalks, which Madam, their mother, had
carefully shredded lest there be found
something which should hurt their tender
little limbs.</p>

<p>She looked about searchingly. Perhaps
they had not all yet arisen, and she
poked the nest over carefully; but her
search was unrewarded and she looked
sadly at Fluffy and Flossy and Flutter as
she prepared to depart on her daily journey,
wondering which one she should
never see again. Finally she turned to
Mr. Field Mouse, who was daintily combing
his long whiskers with his hind foot.
Mr. Field Mouse was very particular as
to his appearance, and never ventured
abroad unless his toilet had been properly
made.</p>

<p>"I think, my dear, we must find a new
dwelling place," she said. "This corn
shock, although snug and having the advantage
of containing an abundance of
homely food, is yet in danger of being
disturbed. I saw yesterday there were
boys at the other side of the field, tearing
down the shocks and pulling off the ears
of corn, and I greatly fear they will continue
until our home will be destroyed
and our darling children eaten by the
cruel dog that sits by them, watching intently.
I am sure he can be looking for
nothing but baby mice," and she looked
tenderly at Fluffy, who was listening interestedly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Field Mouse only continued to
comb, as if her remarks were not worthy
of consideration.</p>

<p>She looked indignantly at him for a
moment, and continued in a louder, more
emphatic tone of voice: "Have you noticed,
Mr. Field Mouse, that only three
of our precious darlings are here? Perhaps
you can tell me where Fatty has
gone; he was here yesterday morning.
You will remember I left them in your
charge while I went to fetch some buckwheat
from the bin."</p>

<p>He looked inquiringly about. "I have
not missed any of them, my dear. You
know I am not very good at arithmetic.
I only left them for a few moments, a very
few, while I went to fetch a bit of that
sugar-cane stacked up by the fence. The
juice is excellent and I felt faint," he said,
apologetically. "If you are not going out
this morning I think I should relish a little
more." He smacked his lips appreciatively.</p>

<p>"You are a gourmand, Mr. Field
Mouse," she said, severely, turning away
in disgust as he scampered off over the
stubble.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that I am able to take
care of myself and our children, too," she
mused, digging her way to the ground
and beginning to throw out the dirt with
her tiny paws.</p>

<p>Soon a neat underground channel was
dug which led out into the open air, and
then Mrs. Field Mouse rested from her
labors and hungrily nibbled a bit of corn.</p>

<p>"We can escape if worst comes to
worst, darlings," she said, reassuringly.</p>

<p>When Mr. Field Mouse returned he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
looked discontentedly over the supper table
where his family were contentedly
nibbling at an ear of nice yellow corn.
"Nothing but corn for supper," he grumbled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Field Mouse resolutely kept her
temper and went on placidly eating.
"Well, have you decided to move?" she
asked, pleasantly. "I have discovered a
barrel of broomcorn seed setting up in
the granary that will make a snug home
for the winter. No one will be likely to
disturb us, and on the whole I think it
will be a desirable change," she said.</p>

<p>"It is too far away from the pile of
sugar cane to suit me, I fear," he said,
curling up in the softest part of the nest,
and covering his nose with his paws was
soon snoring heavily.</p>

<p>"I think this is the shock, Sam. I am
sure I heard a mouse squeal when I went
by this morning. Now, Fido!"</p>

<p>There was a great rattling of stalks, a
sharp bark, a rush and Fido licked his
chops and nosed about the place where
Mr. Field Mouse had been contentedly
snoozing but a few moments before, but
he did not find any more dainty tidbits,
for Mrs. Field Mouse and her children
were safely skurrying away over the stubble
in the direction of the granary.</p>

  <span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Dendrocygna fulva.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<p>The Tree Ducks are natives of tropical
or semi-tropical countries. Two species
are found in the United States, the bird
of our illustration and the Black-bellied
Tree-duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis).
The range of the fulvous species extends
from the southern border of the United
States, and in Nevada and California,
southward through Mexico, and reappears
in the southern portion of Brazil
and in the Argentine Republic. It has
also been reported as a visitor to the
states of North Carolina and Missouri.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank M. Woodruff, in speaking
of his experience while on a collecting
tour in Texas, says, "I found the Fulvous
Tree-Duck in small numbers resident on
Galveston Island, but found them abundant
and nesting in the heavy timber along
the Brazos river, sixty miles from Galveston.
In the early morning, as we would
leave our boat and make our way to our
blinds, on some small inland pond where
we had prepared for collecting, we would
flush immense flocks of this duck, which
would fly over our heads at rather a low
altitude and continuously calling. On
several occasions we obtained specimens
by firing into a flock while it was still so
dark that we could scarcely define the
outlines of the individual birds. The Fulvous
Tree-Duck generally feeds in the
night and usually at a place several miles
from the nesting site. They leave the
feeding grounds on the first sign of approaching
day. During my stay of three
months in the Brazos river region only
on one or two occasions did I have an opportunity
to observe this bird by the light
of day. In form it resembles a miniature
swan. It stands very high on its legs
and presents a wonderfully curious and
graceful appearance as it walks along the
shore feeding on shellfish and decaying
matter."</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_THE_SWIFTS_CAME_TO_BUILD_IN_AUNT_DOROTHYS"
  id="HOW_THE_SWIFTS_CAME_TO_BUILD_IN_AUNT_DOROTHYS"></a>
  HOW THE SWIFTS CAME TO BUILD IN AUNT DOROTHY'S CHIMNEY.</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a family of
Humming Birds who always spent the
winter in Mexico. In this family, besides
the father and mother, there was a grandfather
and grandmother, and also a great-grandfather
and great-grandmother, and
ever so many children. It was the custom
of the Humming Bird family to
spend Christmas day together, and they
assembled early in the morning in a beautiful
live oak tree, the leaves of which
were so much like holly leaves that
no Christmas wreaths were needed. The
tree was a handsome one and suitable in
every way for a Christmas Humming
Bird party. At last every one had come
except young Master Topaza Humming
Bird, who could not resist the temptation
of flying from place to place along the
way, thrusting his long bill, of which he
was very proud, into the beautiful blossoms
which he found, and taking a little
sip of honey from each one. Great-grandfather
Humming Bird missed Master Topaza
and called to his little brother Iris
to go and find him and bring him immediately
to the oak tree. Iris promptly
obeyed and soon returned with his brother.
Then great-grandfather, who always
was given first place on such occasions,
fluttered his wings and said: "Dear children,
were our cousins, the Swifts, invited
to take part with us in our concert this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mamma Humming
Bird, "I met papa Swift one day while I
was getting honey from the beautiful red
blossoms of a shrub which grows in the
southern end of this valley. I invited him
to come to-day and bring all his family,
and he said he would, and also that he
would come early, for he wished to have
us tell him about the lovely place where
we spent last summer."</p>

<p>Little Coquette Humming Bird sat
watching her brother Helenae&mdash;what a
queer name for a boy Humming Bird,
you think&mdash;but probably his parents gave
it to him because he was always prinking
and preening his feathers. "Just like a
girl," his brothers said. But however
much Coquette might preen her feathers,
she never looked as beautiful as her
brother Helenae, and that was what she
was thinking about as she watched him.
He carefully arranged the three long,
slender, greenish-black feathers which
grew on either side of his head, and the
metallic green feathers of his throat were
so glistening and bright that little Coquette
imagined she could see herself in
them as she could in a little spring where
she often went for a drink. After Helenae
had finished his toilet he moved his wings
very rapidly a few times, and raised himself
up as high as he could on his feet
without taking them off the limb on which
he sat, then he settled down, closing his
eyes for a moment. Just then Coquette
cried out: "The Swifts are coming! Look,
no one else could fly so fast! There they
are near those old mahogany trees on the
bank of the river." There was a grand
rustle of preparation that everything
might be in order and every one look his
best when the cousins arrived. In a few
moments mamma Swift and her daughter
Cyprelus came, alighting on the same
branch together. Then there was a whir
of wings that sounded like the wind flapping
the sails on a sail-boat, and there
was an excited chirping of welcomes and
"Merry Christmas" on both sides.</p>

<p>Grandfather Humming Bird was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
good story-teller, and his wife, who was
the dearest old lady Humming Bird in
the world, had often advised him to write
a book of his travels on the leaves of the
lovely rose-laurel bush, but Grandfather
Humming Bird told her that writing
books of travel was too humdrum for a
Humming Bird; that such work was only
for that queer creature called man. Several
Humming Birds then said that they
felt very friendly toward man, because he
loved flowers and took such pains to plant
them every spring. And the Swifts, with
one accord, said they were much indebted
to man for his chimneys, for they made
the best building places possible. "Before
the white man came to this country,"
said grandfather Swift, "our ancestors
had to build their nests in old hollow
trees." "The red man was an admirer
of ours," said uncle Tarsi Swift, who was
an old bachelor and a little cross sometimes.
"I could get along very well without
the white man and his chimneys. He
has driven the red man away, and cut
down the grand old forests. When I was
a child nothing pleased me better than to
see an Indian chief, with his high moccasins
trimmed with feathers. I know
he trimmed them that way to make his
legs look like ours." "But he could not
make his feet look like yours if he tried,"
spoke up a pert young Humming Bird,
who, with a group of others, was looking
and listening in a quiet corner, and he
glanced down at uncle Tarsi Swift's first
toe, which was turned forwards and he
counted the phalanges in uncle Tarsi's
toes and compared them with his own.
Three of Uncle Tarsi's toes were alike,
but all of the pert Humming Bird's were
different.</p>

<p>"No," said several Swifts in chorus,
"only the penguins and cormorants have
toes like ours, and they are birds we seldom
meet. We are glad there are so few
feet exactly like ours. We can tell each
other everywhere by our feet and our ten
tail feathers.</p>

<p>"I knew a swallow once who had lost
two tail feathers," said one of the Swift
cousins, "and he tried to pass himself off
as a Swift. But he could not change his
feet and so he deceived nobody.</p>

<p>"Well, as for me," said the pert Humming
Bird, "I would rather have feet that
were not so peculiar as to attract everybody's
attention." "Indeed," said cousin
Swift, "and what do you think of having a
bill three or four times as long as any of
your neighbors?" "At least my bill does
not open away under my eyes like yours
does, cousin Swift!"</p>

<p>Grandmamma Humming Bird knew
very well that the Humming Bird family
was thought to be quarrelsome by almost
every one, and was very much mortified
by hearing this conversation. "Children,"
she said, "you know it is not right
to hurt people's feelings by talking about
their peculiarities, and I hope none of
my dear little Humming Birds will offend
their Christmas guests." After this there
was no more cross talk in the pert Humming
Bird's corner, for all loved grandmother
Humming Bird and tried to do as
she wished to have them.</p>

<p>There was a sudden lull in the conversation
and great-grandfather Humming
Bird asked grandfather Humming Bird
to describe the place where his family had
spent the summer just passed. "It was a
lovely place near a lake in Southern Wisconsin,"
said he. "Many honeysuckle and
dogwood bushes grew there, and wild
rose bushes, and wild grape vines, and
clematis, and large purple vetches.
Grandmother and I built our nest in a
grapevine angle, and often in the warm
summer evenings the wind would rock
our babies to sleep. There was a place
not far away, which I know you would
find a pleasant home for next summer.
It is up on a hill, not far from the lake.
There is a house there with one chimney
from which the smoke never comes all
summer long. In the big yard there are
beautiful trees and fragrant flowering
shrubs and beds filled with flowers. A
lady lives there who is loved by all the
birds, for she never frightens them, and
every day she feeds them and talks to
them. So they build nests in her trees
and sing for her.</p>

<p>"This summer, in a beautiful shady
place, near a syringa thicket, she made a
house out of a big box for a mother hen
who had fifteen little downy chicks, and
every day when she fed the chickens she
left enough food so that the birds could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
have some, too. And all, even the little
yellow canaries, used to help themselves.
This did not please the old mother hen
very well, and if she could have gotten
out of her box-house, I think she would
have chased the birds away. One day a
bold blackbird walked into her house to
get some grains of corn, when he thought
she was not looking. But before he could
get out again she pulled three feathers
out of his tail and laid them down, as a
warning, where all the other birds could
see them. I heard the lady afterwards
telling the mother hen that she must not
be so selfish, and the next time she fed the
chickens she put several handfuls of corn
where the blackbirds could get it, without
having their tail-feathers pulled out. I
have seen the lady put pieces of string
and bits of soft cotton cloth and old rope
where the birds could get them, to help
make their nests. And I saw her feeding
a little orphan owl with angle worms.
The little owl was very fond of her and
sat on her fingers and twisted his neck
and winked his great eyes. Whenever
he heard her talking he gave a queer little
screech, for he knew her voice. He was a
great eater and he expected her to give
him something to eat every time she went
where he was. One day that lady was sitting
on her porch listening to the birds
singing. At one end of the porch was a
large lilac bush in full bloom, and I was
enjoying myself among the blossoms.
Once in a while I would fly to a flower
bed not far from the opposite end of the
porch, where there was a big bunch of
belladonna with its lovely blue and mauve
blossoms. The lady seemed to like lilacs
best, for she had fastened a large bunch
in her belt, and sat with her hands folded
in her lap, dreaming a day dream, I suppose.</p>

<p>Once, on my way from the flower-bed
to the lilac bush, I flew up to the bunch of
blossoms which the lady had in her belt.
You know I am seldom afraid of anything
and I knew the dear lady would not harm
me. But she seemed very much surprised
when I stopped at her bunch of
blossoms. 'O-o-h!' she said, but very
softly, and unclasped her hands in her
surprise. I flew away quickly to the lilac
bush, and after a while I looked at the
lady and she was smiling pleasantly and
watching me."</p>

<p>When grandfather Humming Bird had
said all this, he flew away to another
branch of the oak tree and moved his
wings so fast that one could not see how
he did it. Papa Swift thanked him for the
pleasure he had given by his stories of his
last summer's home, and it was finally
agreed that the Swifts and Humming
Birds should start together for the north
in the spring.</p>

<p>The young birds of both families were
anxious for the concert to begin. Papa
Swift, who was considered the best singer
by everybody, flew to the very top of the
oak tree and began his prettiest song. It
was not long before several Swifts and
Humming Birds had joined him. They
all sang and flew from branch to branch.
A bird concert is not like one given by
children. The children all sing the same
song and sing it together, but in a bird
concert everyone sings to please himself.
He begins just when he feels like it, and
sings his own song. But for all that, a
bird concert is very pretty music. Some
proud birds, who were spending the afternoon
near by, and who had better
voices than the ones in the oak tree, pretended
that they did not like such a
"noise," as they called it, and flew away
across the river. But this did not keep
the Swifts and Humming Birds from enjoying
themselves.</p>

<p>Before the time for good-byes came they
promised to see each other often, and everyone
promised to be ready to go away
in the spring. Little Cyprelus dreamed
that night of the pleasant times she would
have the next summer in the pretty place
grandfather Humming Bird had told
about, and Coquette and Topaza said they
wondered if the lady who lived by the
beautiful lake would have as many flower-beds
this summer as she had last.</p>

<p>Now this lady, whom grandfather
Humming Bird had been telling about,
was Aunt Dorothy. She was a great bird
lover, and it made her happy to find that
she could number the Swifts among her
particular bird friends when they came
the next summer to live in her yard.</p>

<p>One morning Aunt Dorothy waked up
very early. She looked out of her eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
window and saw that the sky beyond the
lake was a beautiful rose color, but the
sun was not yet risen. Aunt Dorothy was
sleepy, so she closed her eyes again, but
just as she did so she heard a strange
twittering noise and wondered where it
came from. Her curiosity was so great
that she could not go to sleep again, so
she rose and dressed herself and, after
saying a little prayer to the great All-Father
to keep her through the day, she
went to find out what the noise was. But
she had already thought that it must be
birds in the chimney. She climbed up
on a chair and listened near the chimney
hole. Soon she heard a fluttering of
wings and a chirping. Mamma Swift was
coming with some worms for her
babies' breakfast. Her babies, like a
great many girl and boy babies, waked
up very early in the morning and were
quite troublesome. In order to quiet
them, Mamma Swift was forced to find
some worms before sunrise. Aunt Dorothy
was delighted. If she made a little
noise near the chimney hole the baby
birds thought it was their mother coming
with food for them, and they stretched
their heads up out of the nest, so Aunt
Dorothy could see them. Often, when
she was writing or reading in her room
she could hear the birds in the chimney.
She knew the papa and mamma bird had
to work very hard, for they came many,
many times a day with food for the baby
Swifts. But there came a day when the
nest in the chimney was empty, for the little
birds had gone away with their parents
and were learning to fly through the
trees and to catch insects to eat. It made
Aunt Dorothy lonesome to sit in her
room after that, and instead she used to
go out of doors where she could watch
the birds.</p>

<p>One day she took a fire-shovel and
with it managed to loosen the nest and
take it out of the chimney without breaking
it. The shape of it was like half of a
deep saucer, and it was made principally
of the petioles or stems of grapevine
leaves laid across each other as the logs
are in building log houses. The big ends
of the leaf stems alternated with the small
ones and stuck out, making a bristling
outside wall for the nest. There were two
or three very slender cedar twigs no
bigger than a darning-needle used in
making the nest, and these the birds had
brought from a long distance. The nest
looked as if it had been covered with glue,
and this was because the birds had covered
it with their saliva and that held the
leaf stems together just as glue would.
Aunt Dorothy knew a man who went to
some islands in the Pacific ocean, where
the Pigmy Swifts live. Pigmy means little,
and these Swifts are smaller than the
ones who built in Aunt Dorothy's chimney.
The Pigmy Swifts build their nests
in caves. Some of them build very far in
the caves, where it is entirely dark. Aunt
Dorothy's friend went one day with another
man to a cave to get some bird's
nests.</p>

<p>These men had a ladder made of rattan,
on which they had to climb in order to
reach the nests. The man who climbed
highest had a long four-pronged spear,
with a lighted candle fixed on it a few
inches below the prongs. By the aid of
the light he found some nests. With the
spear he took them unbroken from the
rock. When he had gotten a nest between
the prongs of the spear, he held it
so the man lower down on the ladder
could reach the end of it, and let it down
through his hands until he could take the
bird's nest from between the prongs of
the spear and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>When Aunt Dorothy's friend came
back to America he brought some of
these bird's nests with him and gave one
to her.</p>

<p>The Chinese people think these bird's
nests are very good to eat, and make soup
of them. Aunt Dorothy put the nest,
which she had taken from the chimney,
into her cabinet with the one from the
island in the Pacific ocean. One day in
the fall she took some of her little friends
for a walk and they picked up a basketful
of leaf stems under the elm and linden
trees, and with them they made some
bird's nests which they covered with glue
and which looked very much like the one
Aunt Dorothy found in her chimney.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED-BREASTED_SAPSUCKER" id="THE_RED-BREASTED_SAPSUCKER"></a>
  THE RED-BREASTED SAPSUCKER.<br />
  <span class="xx-smaller"><span style="font-weight:lighter;">
  (<i>Sphyrapicus ruber.</i>)</span></span></h2>

<p>The Red-breasted Sapsucker is a resident
of the Pacific Coast, ranging from
northern Lower California northward to
Southern Alaska. It extends its flight
and breeds as far east as the Sierra Nevada
and Cascade Mountains. It belongs
to the family of Woodpeckers (Picidae).
The generic name, Sphyrapicus, is taken
from two Greek words that refer to the
habits of these birds&mdash;sphura, a hammer
and pikos, a woodpecker. The specific
name, ruber, means red.</p>

<p>Like its eastern relative, the Yellow-bellied
Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), it
punctures trees possibly in order to feed
upon the exuding sap or the insects attracted
by its flow, yet this bird does not
develop this habit to so great an extent
as the eastern species, for it will completely
girdle a tree with punctures, which
at times will cause its death. A direct
evidence of this is found in the fact that in
localities where the Red-breasted Sapsucker
is abundant indications of their
work are not usually common. The adult
birds are beautifully marked with crimson
on the head and breast, while in the
young the color is brownish and the yellow
of the belly is wanting.</p>

<p>These birds seem to prefer aspen trees
for their homes, selecting one which is a
foot or more in diameter near the
ground. They excavate a cavity in the
trunk several feet from the ground, the
door of which, a small round hole, less
than two inches in diameter, seems far
too small for the parent birds to enter.
"The gourd-shaped excavation varies in
depth from six to ten inches, and it is
from three inches near the top to four or
five inches wide at the bottom. The finer
chips are allowed to remain in the bottom,
forming the nest proper, on which
the eggs are deposited. The interior of
the entire excavation is most carefully
smoothed off, which must consume considerable
time, considering the tough,
stringy and elastic nature of the wood
when filled with sap, making it even more
difficult to work when partly decayed,
which seems to be the case with nearly all
aspens of any size." The larger chips are
dropped from the nest and their presence
on the ground at the base of the tree is
quite a sure indication of the proximity
of the nest of this or some related species.
The period of incubation probably lasts
twelve or more days, and its labors seem
to be shared by both sexes. During this
period, if the birds are disturbed by a
close approach to their nest, they fly away
for a short distance uttering sounds of a
soft, plaintive character, that are variable
and difficult of description. These Sapsuckers
are watchful and devoted parents
and cases have been reported where the
mother bird has been easily captured because
of her refusal to leave her young.</p>

<p>As a rule, but a single brood is raised
each season. There are five or six eggs
and occasionally seven in each set, which
vary in form though they are always of
the ovate type. At times they are quite
elongated. When fresh, the yolk may be
seen through the thin shell, giving a
pinkish shade to the egg. When the contents
are removed the shell is white,
showing some lustre.</p>

<p>The food of this species, in addition to
the sap and inner bark of the trees they
puncture, if it is true that they use this
as food, consists of ants, insect larvae,
moths and butterflies, many of which are
caught on the wing, and small fruits.</p>

<p>Like all the Sapsuckers and the other
woodpeckers, the sense of hearing is well
developed and it is usually very difficult
to approach them without detection.</p>

<p>A sister species of the Sapsucker of our
illustration is the beautiful Williamson's
Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus thyroideus), an
inhabitant of the Pacific coast. This bird
differs from all of the woodpeckers in that
the two sexes show a great difference in
coloration. So marked is this difference
that for a long time they were described
as distinct species.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WHITE_TABLE_IN_THE_WOODS" id="A_WHITE_TABLE_IN_THE_WOODS"></a>
  A WHITE TABLE IN THE WOODS.</h2>

<p>This is not a tale of far away and long
ago&mdash;in the Black Forest, for instance&mdash;but
a true story of the summer just past,
and it comes from under the shadow of
our own White Mountains, where two
boys made discoveries in the great out of
doors. The boys let me into many of
their secrets, and now the summer is
gone I am allowed to tell this one, because,
if you have never happened to find
a big table spread not under the trees for
picnic people, but high up in a tree for
woods people, you will want to look for
one next summer.</p>

<p>This was, of course, a wooden table, its
cover both snowy and glossy; the plates,
which were round, and all the same size,
were of wood and placed in straight, regular
rows, six hundred and fifty of them&mdash;that
is true, for the boys counted and
computed&mdash;a hospitable board, you
think, and you will be sure of it when you
know the whole story! The butler&mdash;who
was also host&mdash;not only arranged but
carved the plates, and wore a business
suit of black and white, with a bright red
cap and necktie of the same cheerful hue
over a buff shirt.</p>

<p>The feast at this table was continuous,
consisting of choice game, and the sweetest
of sweets. The guests, who came and
went during all the sunshine hours, were
so various in dress and manners that they
could not be compared with those at any
public or private banquet ever known, so
the puzzle must stop here and the plain
facts be told.</p>

<p>The table was twenty feet from the
ground, and set on one side of a tree, so,
though of wood, and as round as the tree,
you see it differed from your dining-table&mdash;and
King Arthur's&mdash;in being tipped
perpendicularly so as to arrange the
plates in straight rows, close together,
thus accommodating more guests. The
table cover was of the best quality of
birch bark. The butler host&mdash;or perhaps
we might call him the architect of
the feast&mdash;was the Yellow-breasted Sapsucker;
if you didn't know him well you
would call him just one of the woodpeckers;
he had all their peculiarities, crawled
around up and down the tree trunk, bracing
himself with his tail, pecking, pounding
and boring, he excavated the hundreds
of round holes, each one a soup
plate to catch and hold the ascending sap.
This is what the Sapsucker seeks, and upon
this alone he can live all summer, as
proved by Mr. Frank Bolles, who tells us
how he caught and kept young Sapsuckers
alive till October, feeding them only
on diluted maple syrup. But tiny insects
are fond of sweets, too; they swarmed
around and lost themselves in our woodpecker's
full soup plates, thus furnishing
him with the animal food needed by such
a worker.</p>

<p>There was always a buzz of bees and
big flies about the tree table, who seemed
to feast and get away safely. These first
attracted our attention, but if we stayed
five minutes we were sure to hear the
dear, familiar sound announcing the most
charming of all guests&mdash;humming birds&mdash;you
know they are brave, brave as they
are beautiful, but we found them shy
about coming too near a Sapsucker; they
hovered over his table as over a flower
bed, often lighting on twigs to watch their
chance at the freshest and fullest dishes.</p>

<p>With the ruby throats, and on the best
of terms with them, came gorgeous butterflies;
the red admiral, the tiger swallow
tail, and the antiopa were always there,
and how bright they were seen against
the snowy birch tree, in dazzling morning
sunshine!</p>

<p>The biggest and boldest of all the free
feeders is on record as having come and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
gone fifteen times in fifteen minutes, a
fat red squirrel, hair brushed and tail
curled, not scolding or chattering here,
he seemed to suspect himself out of place,
for, taking a side seat on an outreaching
branch, he would frisk off when bidden to
go, but back again and again till he had
his fill.</p>

<p>Of course the last bird to leave the tree
at night was the Sapsucker, but when he
and all his family were gone, and the sun
out of sight, we found a swarm of big
yellow bees bustling about the high seats,
and fancied that when at last their work
was done the night moths and bats would
have their turn, and perhaps some brisk
little owl would take the squirrel's perch
for a night lunch, getting away just before
the sunrise concert opened another
day of eating, drinking, and being merry
at the white tree table.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CECROPIA_AND_PROMETHEA_MOTHS" id="THE_CECROPIA_AND_PROMETHEA_MOTHS"></a>
  THE CECROPIA AND PROMETHEA MOTHS.</h2>

<p>In the study of Natural History it is
the habits and life-histories of the living
animals which appeal most strongly to
young people. A large part of the leading
Botanists and Zoologists of this
country began, as young people, their
studies of Nature by collecting animals
and plants and studying their life-history
and habits. It is this dynamical side, the
relation of the animal to its surroundings,
which arouses our interest. Since this
has been the most natural method by
which the interest in nature has been developed,
it is surprising how little this
side of Zoology has been encouraged by
many of our better colleges and universities.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the teacher, insects
as a rule, stand very high with regard
to the interest which they arouse in
scholars for nature-study. This is quite
natural, since the great abundance and
interesting habits of these animals make
them comparatively easy to study.</p>

<p>The two insects which we figure this
month are very common and widely
distributed, and thus have become very
generally known. When we once become
familiar with them, these beautiful moths
are of perennial interest, and each season
one is pleased to renew his acquaintance
with them.</p>

<p>The Cecropia is our largest and to
many persons the best-known moth. Its
gigantic size, varying from about 4 to 7
inches in expanse of wings, together with
its bright colors, makes it an easily remembered
insect. The scientific name
of this moth (Samia cecropia) is the first
scientific name of an insect that many of
us can recall learning. The time of active
flight is at night, and thus it is that they
are so frequently found in numbers about
electric lights to which they have been attracted
by the intense light. Their rather
awkward flight and large size often lead
to their being mistaken for bats.</p>

<p>The differences between the sexes are
not so manifest as in Promethea, yet it is
not difficult to distinguish them. The females
are larger and have stouter bodies,
but the most conspicuous difference is
that the "feelers" or antennae of the male
are feather-like and very large and broad,
while those of the female are only about
one-half as broad.</p>

<p>The eggs are somewhat flattened,
about one-tenth of an inch long, pale in
color, and are deposited by the female in
small patches upon a large variety of
plants, since there are about fifty of these
upon which the larvae will feed. The
eggs usually hatch in about a week or ten
days, the young larvae being very different
in appearance from the mature ones.
The changes in appearance are brought
about by five moults or sheddings of the
skin. The full-grown larva is pale green
or light blue, 3 or 4 inches long, armed
with eight more or less complete rows of
large tubercles. Those above on the second
or third thoracic segment, are bright red;
all the others are yellow except those on
the sides of the body and on the first
thoracic and last body segment, which
are blue. Unfortunately, these colors
soon fade in the dead larva as is seen in
the plate. This wonderful development
of tubercles seems to be in some way related
to the arboreal habits of the larvae.</p>

<p>Although a variety of parasites which
prey upon these larvae is not large, they
are very numerous in individuals, and it
is to this cause that only a small per cent
of the larvae ever produce moths. These
parasites develop beneath the skin of the
larva as footless grubs, which, at first, do
not attack the vital organs, but later these
organs are preyed upon, and the larva
dies. A wasp-like insect which preys upon
this larva well illustrates in its habits
the crudeness of many instincts. The
female will lay eight or ten eggs upon one
caterpillar, but as the young parasitic
grubs require a large amount of food,
only one is able to mature and the others
perish.</p>

<p>The insect parasites seem, in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
cases, to mature and transform into the
adult stage after the caterpillar has built
its cocoon, and thus many parasites lose
their lives, since they are not always able
to escape from the cocoon. A cocoon
will sometimes be found filled with these
small insects, which have not been able
to make their escape, and have thus died
in prison.</p>

<p>The adult larva, unlike Prometha, usually
spins its cocoon not attached to a
leaf, but along a stem; sometimes, however,
they may be placed in other situations.</p>

<p>In about two weeks after the cocoon
has been spun, the larva transforms into
a chrysalis, in which stage it hibernates
during the winter, and from which it
emerges in May or June.</p>

<p>During the winter, when the leaves are
not on the trees and shrubs which are frequented
by these larvae, a large number
of cocoons may easily be collected. These
should be kept out of doors during the
winter, for if kept in a warm room they
will emerge during the winter or so early
in the spring that food cannot be secured
for the larvae.</p>

<p>If one secure a number of old cocoons,
from which the moths have failed to
emerge, and cut them open longitudinally,
he may learn many interesting facts.
A dead and dry mummified looking larva
or chrysalis may be found, or, what is
even more interesting, no trace of the
larva or chrysalis may be present, but
only a mass of small white, paper-like
cocoons. These have been left by a colony
of little wasp-like parasites which
may occur in such large numbers that
there is scarcely room for all to spin their
cocoons, so that on account of being so
closely crowded together, they are
moulded into a mass of cocoons having
the form of the cavity formerly occupied
by the larva.</p>

<p>The cocoons of Cecropia are composed
of two parchment-like layers of silk
which are generally very dense and
strong. The space between these two
layers contains loosely spun threads of
silk like a layer of packing material. The
larvae seem normally to make three varieties
of cocoons; one kind is very loosely
constructed, much larger than the ordinary
form and not attached to a twig, but
found in the grass or in shrubs near the
ground. The two other forms of cocoons
are much smaller and more closely
woven, but differ in size; female moths as
a rule emerging from the larger cocoons,
and males from the smaller ones.</p>

<p>Dead larvae are sometimes found in
cocoons which are practically of a single
thickness; there being no space between
the outer and inner layers. The hollow
skins of the larvae found in such cocoons
clearly show that this unusual cocoon is
due to the influence of parasites upon the
larva.</p>

<p>In the upper open end of the cocoon,
kernels of wheat, corn, beechnuts and
even acorns have been found. How these
get in this position seems to be quite a
puzzle. In opening twenty or thirty
cocoons, five or six kernels of corn have
been found, thus showing that this occurrence
is by no means rare. Chickadees
and blue-jays have been given the
blame for this work, since these birds are
thought to have the habit of hiding food.
The inverted outer layer of the cocoon
clearly shows, in some cases, that the kernel
of corn has been thrust into the
cocoon with some force.</p>

<p>The head of the pupa lies at the small
end of the cocoon, where the texture is
less dense, and thus, when it is ready to
transform into the moth, the head is in
the best position for easy escape from the
cocoon. But this provision alone is not
sufficient to make sure the escape. At
the time of emergence, the pupa secretes
a fluid which escapes from the mouth and
by moistening the cocoon softens the
glue-like material which binds together
the threads, thus making it possible for
the freshly emerging moth to crowd its
way between the fibres, and thus secure
its freedom. When the moth first crawls
out of the cocoon, its heavy body and
small folded wings show but little resemblance
to the fully-expanded moth. By
degrees, however, the wings expand and
become more rigid, the colors brighten,
and finally the mature moth is developed.</p>

<p>The Promethea Moth is only about
one-half the size of Cecropia, and the two
sexes are very different in appearance; so
much so that one would not at all think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
they were the same kind of moths. As
in Cecropia the male moths are somewhat
smaller than the females, and the
antennae show the same kind of differences,
i.e., the antennae of the males are
much larger and feather-like. In color,
the sexes of Cecropia are much alike, but
in this moth the differences in color are
very great, the dominant color in the female
being a reddish brown, while that in
the male is a very dark-brown or almost
black. Thus these moths furnish an excellent
illustration of what is called sexual
dimorphism, a term used for those animals
in which the sexes are very different in
appearance, a subject to which Charles
Darwin gave considerable attention, in
his "Descent of Man."</p>

<p>The female moth lays her cream-colored
eggs, which are a little smaller than
those of Cecropia, upon shrubs and trees
in clusters of five or six. The small larva
usually hatches in about ten days, and
feeds upon the leaves of ash, sassafras,
lilac, tulip tree, maple, cherry, and a number
of other trees and shrubs, but it is
much more select in the choice of its food
than Cecropia. The larvae have voracious
appetites, devour many leaves and grow
at a correspondingly rapid rate. The differences
between the very young and the
adult larva, aside from that of size, are
very great. On account of the very limited
elasticity of the skin, this larva, like
other insect larvae, only increases in size
after shedding. This is periodically accomplished
by throwing off the old skin,
which prevented expansion, and by growing
a new and larger one. Promethea
has from three to five of these moults, the
number being influenced apparently by
climate, since southern larvae have more
moults than northern ones. The time between
these moults varies from two days
to a week.</p>

<p>The leaves upon which the larvae feed
may have long or short petioles. A
singular account has been given of how
these larvae have overcome the difficulties
associated with feeding upon long-petioled
leaves. There is considerable
risk of falling and of the leaf breaking
away when a large larva crawls out upon
a slender petiole. The larva avoids these
risks and yet reaches the blade of the leaf.
This is accomplished as follows: The
larva grasps firmly the branch with its
posterior legs; reaches out a considerable
distance along the petiole, and bites it
through in several places. This causes
the leaf to droop; the larva now reaches
out, seizes the drooping leaf, and draws it
within convenient reach, where it can be
eaten at leisure. This is a wonderful display
of instinct, yet it is not infallible, because
at times the petioles are eaten too
far through, and when they droop, break
completely away and fall to the ground.</p>

<p>When ready to spin its cocoon, the
adult larva is about two inches long;
these cocoons are very different from
those of Cecropia. As a rule, they are
found suspended from a branch by a silken
cord, the length of which depends upon
the length of the petiole of the leaf in
which the cocoon was spun. Thus if the
leaf has only a short petiole, this cord is
also short, but if the petiole is two or
three inches long, the suspensory cord is
correspondingly long. The larva in constructing
its cocoon, first spins a strong
band around a twig, and binds the petiole
of the leaf to the stem; this band extends
down the petiole to the cocoon, and thus
anchors it. The cocoon proper, or the
part occupied by the chrysalis, is spun in
a folded leaf. When this leaf dies and
rots away, the cocoon hangs freely suspended
by the cord, but it is very evident
that the cocoon has been moulded in a
leaf by the prints of the veins which remain
upon it. A valve-like opening occurs
in the upper end, through which the
moth emerges.</p>

<p>The wings of the chrysalis are very
small as compared with those of the adult
moth; are folded to the body on the under
side, and covered by the pupal skin. During
the winter they remain transparent
since there are at this time none of the
rich colors present which are later found
in the moth. About ten days before the
moth emerges the wings become white,
a few days later definite colors begin to
appear on the under side of the wings
between the veins. While in the adult
moths the colors in the two sexes are
very distinct, at this time their wings are
very similar. The wings do not long retain
this similarity, but gradually become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
more and more unlike until maturity.</p>

<p>Breeders of moths have often noticed
that there is considerable uniformity with
regard to the time of day at which certain
kinds of moths emerge. For Promethea
this time seems to be in the forenoon.</p>

<p>From an extensive series of experiments,
it has been learned that the male
finds his mate by means of scent and that
this is doubtless the explanation for the
very large antennae of the male, since it
is in these organs that the sense of smell
is located.</p>

<p>Although it may be very interesting to
read about the activities of insects, a
much more fascinating side of the subject
is to handle and study the insects
themselves, and there are but few better
insects with which to begin a personal acquaintance
than these which we have
been considering.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PLEA_FOR_LEGISLATIVE_PROTECTION" id="A_PLEA_FOR_LEGISLATIVE_PROTECTION"></a>
  A PLEA FOR LEGISLATIVE PROTECTION.</h2>

<p>In former numbers of Birds and Nature
we have seen how much our welfare
and happiness depends upon the birds.
Some hints have been given as to how we
may encourage the birds to become residents
of our premises so that we may enlist
them in the constant warfare against
worm and weevil. If there were no great
and universal interest at stake in this
question, How much do we owe to the
birds? we should, perhaps, have no right
to go beyond simple encouragement to
the birds to multiply and do their good
work in certain chosen places. But the
interests are universal and so deeply concern
the whole world that we have an undoubted
right to say to those who would
kill everything in sight, either for gain or
for so-called "sport," Thou shalt not! In
other words, we have the right to make
laws forbidding anybody to kill birds except
for the best of reasons. This right
has been acted upon in most states and
in many foreign countries, where various
degrees of protection to the birds as well
as to other animals have been secured.</p>

<p>But in very many, if not in most cases,
the laws enacted have not furnished protection
enough. Those who have put a
price upon a bird's plumage, who furnish
the temptation for others to break the law
against killing birds, have not had a
check put upon them. And the class of
"sportsmen" which regards anything living
(except man and some of the domestic
animals) as legitimate targets for their
weapons, have not been dealt with severely
enough. Even where the laws have
seemed prohibitive enough they have
often failed of their purpose because not
properly enforced. There are, then, two
things to be considered. First, the passage
of laws that will be prohibitive, and,
second, machinery adequate to their enforcement.</p>

<p>The first question will then be, How
may we secure the passage of laws such
as we need? Certainly not by waiting for
the state legislatures to do it. In such
matters, at least, they wait for an expression
of the people. Then agitate the
question until the time is ripe for presenting
it before the lawmakers of your state
and push it. Write to Mr. Witmer Stone,
the chairman of the American Ornithologists'
Union, chairman of the Committee
on Bird Protection, for a copy of the ideal
law, and then act in line with other states.
If each state acts in accord with some
plan for the whole country, we shall have
practically a national protective law. But
even this community of interest will not
accomplish the purpose for which we set
out, even as a law, saying nothing of enforcement.
All this is directed against
the killing of birds. The law must prohibit
the sale of the bird or any part of its
plumage for any purpose. Carefully
guarded exceptions or privileges might
be favorable to those who need material
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
for strictly scientific study. But it is necessary
to go even further than this. We
shall not accomplish our purpose until a
law is enacted prohibiting the importation
of feathers, whether on the skin or
separated from it. If we are not yet ready
to say that no feathers may be imported,
then let us absolutely prohibit the importation
of any part of any species of our
native birds, whether killed in America
or anywhere else. That much lies within
our power. Evidently we are not yet
ready to say that birds, or parts of birds&mdash;meaning
our native birds&mdash;shall not be
worn as an article of dress. We need a
long campaign of education before that
will be feasible.</p>

<p>What, now, of the enforcement of these
laws? Clearly the enforcement of any
law must have behind it a public sentiment
demanding enforcement. A law
fails to be prohibitive when it receives
only indifferent attention from the public
for whom it was passed. It is our privilege
to so bring to the attention of the
people at large their own great interests,
which are dependent upon the birds, that
their eyes shall be opened to see the great
necessity of prompt and united action.
The great growth of popular interest in
the birds during the past three years is
the clearest proof that the time is now
ripe for such a campaign of education.
Push it now. In every mind there lies
dormant an interest in nature which needs
but a touch now to be awakened to activity
and usefulness.</p>

<p>But there is still the machinery of enforcement
to be considered, for however
much the general public may be educated
there will always be some persons,
not a small number, we fear, who must
be held in check by legislative action. In
the first place, game wardens are too few,
in most counties, to properly enforce the
laws. They should be numerous enough
and so situated that they may be reached
readily. But if this increase in number
be not practicable, then there is a way out
of the difficulty. We must be more active
ourselves. In a large majority of
cases we shall have no need to cause arrests,
but need only to inform the transgressor
of the existence of the law, giving
him some useful information of the great
good which the birds do, and of the pleasure
which may be gained from a study
of the living bird, and the purposes of the
law will be accomplished. For many
times the transgressor is of foreign birth,
knowing nothing of the esteem in which
we hold the birds. Or else the person is
simply thoughtless, or ignorant of the law
and its purposes. The other cases of
flagrant breaking of the law need and deserve
prompt and severe treatment. Here
it is often not a matter of education but of
discipline. It is not pleasant to be an informer,
but such cases should be put upon
a par with any other sort of law-breaking,
for there is a great public interest involved
beside which our own personal interest,
however great that may be, sinks
into insignificance. It is a duty which we
have no right to shirk.</p>

<p>To summarize the means by which we
may hope to secure adequate protection
for our rapidly decreasing birds: Legislative
action brought about by combined
effort throughout the country; enforcement
of the laws enacted by an increase
in the public interest, by an increase of
the number of game wardens, by our own
activity in seeing that the laws are enforced.
By these means we may accomplish
what we undertake.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DOG_AND_ITS_ANCESTORS" id="THE_DOG_AND_ITS_ANCESTORS"></a>
  THE DOG AND ITS ANCESTORS.</h2>

<p>That the domestic dog has been held in
high esteem by mankind from the earliest
times, is shown by written records and
mummified remains obtained from countries
situated widely apart. The statement
occurs in the Zendavesta, that "the
world exists through the intellect of the
dog." Cuvier wrote that "the dog is the
completest, the most singular and the
most useful conquest that man has ever
made * * * each individual is devoted
to man and remains attached to him even
unto death; and all this springs not from
necessity nor from fear, but from a true
friendship. The dog is the only animal
that has followed man all over the globe."</p>

<p>Egyptian monuments dating back
3,400 years B. C., show several varieties
of dogs, most of them being allied to the
greyhound. Carved records of a later
period portray the mastiff, a turnspit and
a form closely resembling the hound.
Without question the dog was domesticated
in Europe previous to any historical
record. His remains are found in the
kitchen-middens of Neolithic times and
an increasing size in the animals is noticed
through the Bronze and Iron ages
in Denmark. Remains of the Neolithic
in Switzerland disclose skulls closely resembling
our hounds, setters or spaniels.
The Americans had indigenous dogs before
the conquering Spaniards introduced
European species, and mummies of dogs
are found in the oldest Peruvian tombs.</p>

<p>All this goes to show that the differentiation
of the dog took place at a very
early date. As in the case of man, the
link is missing, but the ancestry is certain.
Without question the varieties of
the dog originated in domestication and
inter-breeding of different species of
wolves living in various parts of the
world.</p>

<p>The dog family is divided into three
groups. First, the wolves or wild dogs,
having a round pupil in the eye and a
short tail. Second, the foxes, which are
characterized by a slit-like pupil and a
long bushy tail; and, third, the long-eared
dogs which inhabit eastern deserts and
possess more numerous and a different
set of teeth than the other groups. Considered
as a family they are distinguished
by a lean body, small head, the slim or
long legs terminated by small paws furnished
with strong but not retractile
claws. The fore paws usually have five
toes while the hind paws are always limited
to four. As the dogs do not live exclusively
on animal food they are not as
savage as the cats, neither do they possess
the "soulless expression of face so
characteristic of the felidae."</p>

<p>While most of the dog family are
gregarious, certain forms lead lives that
are solitary or nearly so. Other species
are nocturnal in their habits, while yet
others burrow in the earth for shelter or
protection. All bend the joints of the
legs in walking, all possess great speed
and endurance, and without exception
are good swimmers.</p>

<p>Intellectually, dogs are more highly developed
than any other brute animal.
Many forms act with a rational deliberation
and follow carefully thought-out
plans. The senses are wonderfully developed.
The sense of smell is marvelous
in many forms, while strength of eyesight
distinguishes others.</p>

<p>Of the three groups mentioned, the
wolf without question was the ancestor
of the domestic dog. In the German
mythology, he was consecrated to the
god Woden, but when Christianity reconstructed
old beliefs, Woden was metamorphosed
into "The Wild Hunter," and
the wolves became his attending dogs,
which finally were evolved into the
ghost-like wolves of nursery and fable.
The wolf has all the attributes of the dog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
except the nobility which necessarily
comes from education. The tail always
droops, never curling upwards as in the
domestic dogs, and even when tamed
they rarely wag the tail. Among the
wolves may be mentioned the jackals of
Asia, which are said to have entered
largely into the breeds of oriental dogs.
These were known to the ancients as
"gold wolves," and are said to be the foxes
whose tails Samson set on fire in order
to burn the fields and vineyards of the
Philistines. The Indian wild dog, or
"Kolsun" is claimed by many to be the
progenitor of all domesticated dogs. He
closely resembles a greyhound, and is
found all over the Himalaya and East India
country. He exhibits many traits
characteristic of our hunting dogs.</p>

<p>Prominent among several distinctive
and familiar breeds of dogs is the Greyhound,
which while graceful and universally
popular as a pet, and a sporting dog,
is unfaithful and unsympathetic. The
great lung capacity gives the animal unusual
endurance, but while possessed of
keen sight and hearing, the sense of smell
is very deficient. The Mastiffs constitute
another group embracing many of the familiar
forms. Among these are the Danish
dog, the German Mastiffs, the Bulldog
and the Pug. With the exception of the
Pug, which is justly called a caricature of
a dog, the group is remarkable for fidelity,
courage, determination and strength.
Great Britain is the home of the Hounds
which, because of their intelligence and
docility, are considered to be in the first
rank of domestic dogs. All the varieties
of this group are born hunters, being
strong, swift and possessed of unusually
keen senses, especially that of smell.
Among these are the Pointers, the German
Bloodhounds, the Staghounds, the
Beagles, and the Foxhound. This last is
justly considered the greatest of hunting
dogs, possessing the speed of the greyhound,
the courage of the bulldog, the
delicate scent of the bloodhound and the
sagacity of the poodle, he is well equipped
for his duties in field and forest.</p>

<p>Probably no two dogs have so endeared
themselves to mankind as the St.
Bernard and the Newfoundland. Both
of these, together with the Spaniels, Setters
and the sagacious Poodles make up
the Spaniel group. While as a class they
are not remarkable for docility or endurance,
these defects are more than compensated
by a superior intelligence, fidelity,
courage, keen scent and great speed.
Much has been written about the qualities
of the Newfoundlands and St. Bernards.
The first are said to be the best
of all water dogs, possessed of great
beauty and an exceptional fund of good
nature, gentleness and gratitude. The
heroic deeds of the others are inseparably
linked with their native home, the
Hospice of St. Bernard. The intelligence
and courage exhibited by these
dogs among the avalanches and frozen
wastes of their mountain homes have
given them a place in history and earned
for them the title of "The worthiest of
them all."</p>

<p>The Setter, which is illustrated in this
article, is an excellent type of a certain
class of the Spaniels. The animal is an
excellent hunting dog and gains its name
from its habit of crouching close to the
ground when pointing game.</p>

<h2><a name="A_FAVORITE_HAUNT" id="A_FAVORITE_HAUNT"></a>A FAVORITE HAUNT.</h2>

<p>Children, as a rule, especially those
born and raised in the rural districts, have
some favorite haunt where they especially
delight to spend their time and where certain
pleasant associations are formed, the
memory of which is treasured in after
years.</p>

<p>The writer was no exception to this
rule, and he will endeavor to describe a
certain "Deserted Limestone Quarry,"
which, in his case, was the favorite haunt
of childhood. A perusal of the following
will give my readers an idea of the general
appearance of the locality. In the
center was a large body of deep water,
bounded on three sides by steep banks,
interspersed with huge rocks and sandstone
boulders. On the fourth side was a
cart road leading to the double stone lime
kiln, then out of use. The south bank
was bordered by a piece of woodland,
through which ran a little rippling brook,
and the other three sides by pasture
fields. Within the deep gulch, and extending
around about two-thirds of the
body of water, was a combined cart road
and pathway, at the extreme end of which,
lying under two large, overhanging rocks,
was a spring of most delicious water. It
was quite deep, but you could see the
golden sand and white pebbles at the bottom
very plainly. Hanging from the
banks above mentioned were numerous
sumach bushes and blackberry briars.
Such were the natural surroundings of
my favorite haunt. A charming place,
indeed; quiet, retired, and a veritable paradise
for the admirer of nature's beauties.</p>

<p>Now a few words regarding the many
little friends with which I associated, and
whose habits and daily lives I studied.
Within the lime kiln a pair of Pewees
built their nest; among the briars on the
bank, the Song Sparrows reigned; in the
piece of woodland referred to were the
nests of a Green Heron, of Blue Jays,
Crows, Cat Birds, Wood Thrushes,
Crested Flycatchers, etc. I also observed
Belted Kingfishers on many occasions,
but never found a nest. Owing to the
large number of insects around the water
the quarry was a favorite feeding ground
for King Birds, Pewees and Swallows,
and they could be seen skimming over the
surface of the water from early dawn to
the twilight of evening.</p>

<p>Aside from this large bird population,
there were land and water turtles, snapping
turtles, frogs in all stages of transformation,
sun and catfish, many beautiful
butterflies, and a family of little gray
rabbits. I had the pleasure of seeing the
latter when they were scarcely larger
than small kittens. Along the borders of
the woods were gray squirrels, ground
squirrels and ground hogs. Thus, in this
one particular, opportunity was afforded
for the study of a large number of natural
history subjects. Here, too, was the
pleasant odor of fresh green spearmint
and the sweet scent of wild roses. In the
early spring time a profusion of wild violets
(blue and yellow), dog-tooth violets,
blood roots, spring beauties, anemones,
"jack-in-the-pulpit," belwort and hare-bell
were to be found in the strip of woodland,
and later in the season the pasture
fields were covered with buttercups and
daisies.</p>

<p>Were all details entered into, a volume
could be written concerning this old
quarry and the many happy hours spent
there, but I will not burden my readers
with further reminiscences of my favorite
haunt.</p>

<h2><a name="CARNIVOROUS_PLANTS" id="CARNIVOROUS_PLANTS"></a>CARNIVOROUS PLANTS.</h2>

<p>This name has been given to certain
plants which have developed the curious
habit of capturing insects and using them
for food. This behavior seems at first
sight most unplantlike, but it is discovered
that the actual food of all plants is
practically the same as that of animals.
The chief peculiarity of carnivorous
plants, therefore, does not lie in the food
which they use, but in the methods which
they have worked out for securing it.</p>

<p>They are all green plants, and hence are
able to make food for themselves, but
they live in surroundings which are poor
in some of the material which they need
in the manufacture of food, so that they
have learned to supplement their food by
capturing insects or other small animals.
When it was discovered that these plants
not only captured insects, but secreted
substances for digesting them, it was
thought to be a very astonishing fact. It
is found, however, that all plants have digestive
substances to act upon their food
materials, and that animals are not peculiar
in this regard. It would seem, therefore,
that the use of such food as the
bodies of insects and the digesting of this
food are not facts which are peculiar to
carnivorous plants, but belong to all
plants as well.</p>

<p>It is interesting, however, to observe
the various devices which plants have
adapted for capturing their prey, and it is
these various devices which form the
subject of this paper.</p>

<p>Prominent among the carnivorous
plants are the pitcher plants, whose leaves
form tubes, or urns, or pitchers of various
forms, which contain water, and to
which insects are attracted and drowned.
There is a very common pitcher plant in
our northern bogs, in whose urn-like
leaves insects are found drowned, but
which does not have such elaborate arrangements
for their capture as other
forms. Perhaps the most famous of the
pitcher plants is one which is common
throughout the southern states. The
leaves are shaped like slender hollow
cones, and rise in a tuft from the swampy
ground. The mouth of this conical urn
is overarched and shaded by a hood in
which are translucent spots like small
windows. Around the mouth of the urn
are glands which secrete a sweet liquid,
and drops of this nectar form a trail down
the outside of the urn. Inside, just below
the rim of the urn, is a glazed zone so
smooth that insects cannot walk upon it.
Below the glazed zone is another zone
thickly set with stiff downward-pointing
hairs, and below this is the liquid in the
bottom of the urn. If a fly is attracted by
the nectar drops on this curious leaf, it
naturally follows the trail up to the rim
of the urn where the nectar is abundant.
If it attempts to descend into the urn it
slips on the glazed zone and falls into
the water; and if it attempts to escape
by crawling up the side of the urn, the
thick-set, downward-pointing hairs prevent.
If it seeks to fly away from the rim
it flies towards the translucent spots in
the hood, which look like the way of escape,
as the direction of entrance is in the
shadow of the hood. Pounding against
the hood the fly falls into the water. This
southern pitcher plant is known as a great
fly catcher, and is frequently used for this
purpose in the south.</p>

<p>The very largest of the pitcher plants
is one which grows in the swamps of California,
whose leaves sometimes become
as much as two or three feet high, the
huge pitchers forming the most capacious
receptacle for insects of all kinds
and sizes. Its general plan is like that of
the southern pitcher plant described
above, in that it has an overarching hood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
with translucent spots, and a trail of nectar
which leads to the dangerous rim. It
has become further elaborated, however,
in that the hood extends into a gaudy
fish-like appendage, whose colors and
flapping serve to attract the flying as well
as the creeping insects. The pitcher, also,
instead of being straight, is spirally twisted,
and has a wing-like expansion which
serves as a guide in the spiral ascent to
the rim, and leads the victim with definiteness
and certainty to the region of danger.
The fish-tail appendage is also
smeared with the nectar secretion, so that
any flying insect lighting upon it is enticed
under the overshadowing arch and
is almost sure of capture.</p>

<p>The most common pitcher plants of the
tropics are the Nepenthes, one of which
is shown in our illustration. It will be
noticed that each leaf when fully formed
consists of three distinct regions, namely,
the leaf-like blade, which is continued
into a tendril which coils around a support,
and the tendril in turn ends in a curiously-formed
pitcher, which has a more
or less complete lid. These pitchers are
often mottled with bright colors, and as
they swing at the ends of the tendrils they
seem to attract the attention of roving insects.
Around the rim of the pitcher a
very definite row of glands may be observed,
which secrete the nectar to which
the insects are attracted. The arrangements
within the pitcher are such as have
been described for the ordinary pitcher
plant. These pitchers of Nepenthes are
usually found containing insects, and
often very many of them, whose bodies
are being slowly digested and the products
absorbed by the plant.</p>

<p>Another group of carnivorous plants
consists of the sun-dews which grow in
swampy regions and are quite common in
our sphagnum swamps. While the
pitcher plants depend upon luring insects
to their death by drowning, the sun-dews
depend upon stickiness. The leaves form
small rosettes on the ground and are of
various shapes. In one of the most common
forms the leaf blade is round, and
the margin is beset by prominent bristle-like
hairs, each with a globular gland
at its tip. Shorter gland-bearing hairs are
scattered over the inner surface of the
blade. All of these glands secrete a clear
sticky fluid which hangs to them in drops
like dewdrops, and since these dewdrops
are not dispelled by the sun the
plants have been called the sun-dews. If
a small insect, in flying or creeping across
the plant, happens to touch one of the
sticky drops it becomes entangled, and
then there follows a curious scene. If the
insect is small, the single bristle-like hair,
in whose sticky drop it has become entangled,
will begin to bend inwards and will
finally press the captured insect down upon
the body of the leaf where the short
glandular hairs receive it. If the insect
is strong enough, however, to escape
from a single sticky drop, neighboring
hairs will bend toward the one which has
captured the insect, and by adding their
mite of strength and glue, succeed in detaining
it until they all bend inwards and
press it down upon the leaf. In some
cases the whole half of a leaf will roll inwards
in this attempt to secure an insect.
In this position the captured insect is
gradually digested and its nutritive substances
absorbed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous and remarkable
of the fly-catching plants is the Venus
fly-trap, known only in swamps near
Wilmington, North Carolina. This fly-trap
does not depend upon drowning the
insects, or upon sticking them fast, but
upon its quickness of movement. Of
course this seems most wonderful in
plants, which are not ordinarily endowed
with powers of quick motion. Dionaea,
for this is the name of the Venus fly-trap,
has a cluster of small leaves rising from
the marshy ground, just as is the case
with pitcher plants and sun-dews. The
lower part of the leaf is like any ordinary
blade, but above becomes pinched almost
in two, and then suddenly flares out again
into a round blade-like expansion which
is constructed like a steel trap, the two
halves snapping together and the marginal
bristles interlocking like the teeth
of a trap. A few sensitive hair-like feelers
are developed on the leaf surface, and
when one of these is touched by a small
flying or hovering insect, the trap snaps
shut and the insect is caught.</p>

<p>Many interesting experiments have
been performed with Dionaea to show its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
quickness and its recognition of suitable
food material. For example, although it
will snap shut at the touch of a pencil
point, or any other indigestible substance,
it soon opens again; while in the case of
a digestible substance the trap remains
closed until digestion has taken place. It
has been claimed further that when the
trap has closed its bristles do not interlock
closely at first, so that between
the crevices very small insects may crawl
out and escape. In such an event the
trap opens again and waits for other prey.
If this be true, it follows that the leaf does
not undertake the rather long process of
digestion until an insect of suitable size
has been captured, one which cannot escape
through the meshes of the bristles.
Digestion is slow work with Dionaea as
with an anaconda, being said to occupy
not less than two weeks.</p>

<p>Among the common marsh plants in
certain regions are the bladderworts, so-called
because their bodies are kept afloat
in water by means of numerous little
bladders. While these bladders are used
in this fashion, they also serve as most effective
traps for certain very small water
animals related to the insects. Each bladder
has a sort of opening which is guarded
by a door like that of an ordinary rat
trap. From the side of this entrance hairs
are floating and waving in the water, and
within the transparent bladder are other
waving tufts of hairs. For some reason
these things are attractive to the minute
water animals, and they push aside the
easily-moved trap door, and entering the
bladder find escape impossible, for the
door, which was easy to push aside on entering,
cannot possibly be moved outwards.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that carnivorous
plants are peculiar in the kind of food
they use, but merely in the source from
which they obtain it. There are other
green plants which supplement their food
supply by preying upon other plants. For
example, the mistletoe is able to manufacture
a certain amount of food for itself,
but it adds to this supply by absorbing
prepared food from the trees upon which
it grows. The dodder is another illustration
of a high grade plant which begins
life independently, but presently
breaks its connection with the soil and
becomes entirely dependent upon the
plants around which it twines and from
which it absorbs.</p>

<p>A great many plants are known as
root-parasites, that is, they absorb from
the underground parts of other plants.
This is notably the case with the orchids
and heaths, which have the appearance
above ground of being entirely independent,
but which really are quite dependent
upon the underground parts of other
plants.</p>

<p>One of the lowest groups of plants,
known as the fungi, have cultivated most
completely the habit of dependence on
other organisms. They attack both plants
and animals, and are often exceedingly
destructive. Among the better known of
these parasites are the rusts, which attack
and destroy many of our most useful
crops. To the fungi there also belong the
well-known bacteria, which are the cause
of numerous contagious diseases both
among plants and animals. It will be observed
that these parasites are using exactly
the same sort of food as do the carnivorous
plants. This does not appear
so striking in this case, simply because
the attacking plants are so much smaller
than the organisms attacked that they do
not seem to capture them, although they
are often none the less effective in destroying
them.</p>

<p>The may-apple is a small perennial herb
with long root-stocks or underground
stems (rhizomes), a native of the United
States and Canada, growing in rather
moist woodlands. The rhizomes attain
a length of about twelve feet; they are
sparingly branched with comparatively
few roots at the nodes. Upon closer inspection
one may notice the leaf scars and
stem scars. Early in the spring the bud
situated at the anterior end of the root-stock
or rhizome, develops and sends up
a stem upon which the leaves and flower
are situated. The entire plant attains a
height of about twelve inches. The leaves
are large, peltate (from pelta, a small
shield), margin deeply from five to nine
lobed, lobes pendant thus giving the leaf
a semblance to an umbrella. It is remarkable
that the flowerless plants have
only one leaf, while the flowering specimens
always have two, which are opposite
upon the stem apex, carrying the
flower in the bifurcation as shown in the
illustration.</p>

<p>Each plant bears a single flower upon
a drooping stalk. The calyx consists
of six greenish sepals, which, however,
drop off as soon as the flower begins to
unfold. The corolla consists of six or
nine petals, which are quite large, thick
and pulpy, and of a creamy white color.
Authorities seem to differ as to the odor
of the flower. Some speak of it as very
fragrant; others designate it as nauseous
and others express no opinion. Millspaugh,
in his "Medicinal Plants," says,
"The odor of the flowers is nauseous; I
am always forcibly reminded of a bad
case of ozaena when inhaling their perfume (?)."
It is an undoubted fact that
the rhizomes, stems and leaves have a
very decided heavy, nauseous odor, and it
is not unreasonable to assume that this
odor is traceable in flower and unripe
fruit.</p>

<p>The flowers expand in May and the
fruit ripens in August. The fruit is a
berry about the size of a plum. At first
green, it changes to a soft yellow at maturity.
It is not unlike a tomato in general
appearance. When fully ripe it has a
fragrant odor and tastes somewhat like
the paw-paw (Asimina triloba).</p>

<p>Podophyllum peltatum is variously
known as may-apple, Indian apple, hog
apple, wild lemon and raccoon berry in
reference to the fruit; duck's foot (German,
Entenfuss) in reference to the form
of the leaf; wild jalap in reference to its
medicinal properties, which are similar
to that of jalap. The generic name Podophyllum,
meaning foot-leaf, is given in
reference to the leaf. The plant is also
quite generally known as mandrake or
American mandrake, but the mandrake
proper, so frequently referred to in the
books of Moses and in the works of
Shakespeare, is not the may-apple but
Mandragora officinalis L. of the night-shade
family (Solanaceae), a native of
southern Europe. Earlier collectors supposed
the two plants to be similar if not
identical. There is only one other species
of Podophyllum which is a native of
Europe.</p>

<p>Apart from its beauty the may-apple
is highly valued for its fruit, which is considered
a delicacy by the American Indians.
Whites apparently do not care
much for the fruit, though it is occasionally
collected and eaten. The taste of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
fully ripe fruit is quite pleasant. Some
state it is like that of a tomato, and it certainly
is not very nutritious. It must only
be sparingly eaten because of its decidedly
laxative properties. The entire plant
is quite poisonous and it is stated that
the cooked leaves have been eaten for
"greens" with fatal results. The Indians
have employed the plant medicinally for
centuries.</p>

<p>The principal use of the American
mandrake is medicinal. It is a very efficient
cathartic, due to the presence of a
resinous principle known as podophyllin,
which has been given the name "vegetable
calomel." It is no doubt true that
this drug is in no small measure responsible
for the decrease in the use of the old-time
mineral drug calomel. Both rhizomes
and leaves may be employed, but
the former contain more of the active
principle. The drug is rarely given alone
because of the griping it produces; it is
combined with hyoscyamus and belladonna,
also with aloes and colocynth. In
large doses it usually acts as an emetic,
which would tend to prevent poisoning
from an overdose. Podophyllin has been
used in dropsy, scrofula and rheumatic
affections. Applied externally it acts as a
powerful irritant, similar to capsicum and
mustard plaster.</p>
